# Build the docker image 
`build-dremio.sh`
The content of ./backup (at the moment where the image is built) is copied to the image

# Start a container
`run-dremio.sh`
Dremio will load the the backup files that was copied when building the image.
In addition, the content of ./backup will be mounted to /tmp/dremio_backup in the container, in order to save changes made to the Dremio configuration 


# Edit the Dremio configurarion (data sources, reflections, etc.) with the Dremio GUI
. Start a container:
`run-dremio.sh`
. Use the web GUI to edit the configuration:
address: http://localhost:9047/)
id: "dremio"
pwd: "dremio123"
. Backup into /tmp/dremio_backup in the container (this will update the content of ./backup on the host).
`./backup-dremio.sh`
. Re-build the image with the updated backup files:
`build-dremio.sh`
