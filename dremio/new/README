# Build the Dremio image 
`build-dremio.sh`
The content of ./backup (at the moment where the image is built) is copied to the image
When starting a container created from this image, Dremio will restore from this backup.


# Create and start a "read-only" container
`run-dremio.sh`



# Edit the Dremio configurarion (data sources, reflections, etc.) with the Dremio GUI

. Create and start a container:
`runMount-dremio.sh`
The content of ./backup will be mounted to /tmp/dremio/backup in the container, allowing to save changes made to the Dremio configuration.
Alternatively, restart an existing container where this folder was mounted:
`docker start <CONTAINER_ID>`

. Use the web GUI to edit the configuration:
address: http://localhost:9047/
id: "dremio"
pwd: "dremio123"

. Backup into /tmp/dremio_backup in the container (this will update the content of ./backup on the host).
`./backup-dremio.sh <CONTAINER_ID>`

. Re-build the image with the updated backup files:
build-dremio.sh`
